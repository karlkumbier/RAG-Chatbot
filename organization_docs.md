* State / history should be handled by higher-level agents
    * Base agents: no history
    * "Person" agents: history

In our case: Picard maintains history
  - Other agents perform tasks assigned by picard
  - Agents can keep track of their own message history as necessary for task completeion (i.e., scratchpad â€” used when agents have debugging functionality)
