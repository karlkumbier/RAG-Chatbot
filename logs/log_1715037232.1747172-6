        "content": "Cancer stem cells are a subpopulation of cells within a tumor that have the ability to self-renew and differentiate into various cell types found within the tumor. These cells are believed to play a role in drug resistance by contributing to tumor heterogeneity and promoting tumor regrowth after treatment. Here are a few ways in which cancer stem cells can contribute to drug resistance:\n\n1. Enhanced DNA repair mechanisms: Cancer stem cells have been found to have more efficient DNA repair mechanisms compared to other tumor cells. This allows them to repair DNA damage caused by chemotherapy or radiation, making them less susceptible to the effects of these treatments.\n\n2. Activation of drug efflux pumps: Cancer stem cells can upregulate the expression of drug efflux pumps, such as ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. These pumps actively pump chemotherapy drugs out of the cells, reducing their intracellular concentration and effectiveness.\n\n3. Quiescent phenotype: Cancer stem cells can enter a quiescent or dormant state, where they become less active and less susceptible to the effects of chemotherapy. This quiescent state allows them to survive treatment and later give rise to new tumor cells.\n\n4. Altered signaling pathways: Cancer stem cells often have dysregulated signaling pathways that contribute to their survival and drug resistance. These pathways can include those involved in self-renewal, such as the Notch, Wnt, and Hedgehog pathways, which promote the survival and maintenance of cancer stem cells.\n\nIt is important to note that the role of cancer stem cells in drug resistance is still an active area of research, and there may be additional mechanisms involved.

Bona fide resistance can develop from drug-tolerant cells through acquisition of new genetic mutations, thus requiring new genetic diversification (Figure 3). Notably, acquisition of EGFR T790M gatekeeper mutations by tolerant cells leads to more robust tumor cell phenotypes. These cells are less sensitive to T790M targeting third-generation EGFR inhibitors compared with T790M mutations on the background of therapy naive cells (Hata et al., 2016). By maintaining a reservoir of viable tumor cells, tolerance enables acquisition of multiple distinct resistance mechanisms, thus supporting more heterogeneous relapse, which reduces chances of second-line therapy success. Similarly, in colorectal carcinomas treatment with EGFR and BRAF inhibitors downregulates DNA repair pathways and upregulates error-prone polymerases in drug-tolerant persister cells, therefore increasing mutation rates and the likelihood of resistance (Russo et al., 2019).\nCancer Cell 37, April 13, 2020 477 Cancer Cell",

In cancer, the prospect that these drug-tolerant persister cells serve as a reservoir for subsequent evolution of diverse stable drug resistance mechanisms makes them attractive targets for new therapies. However, the success of strategies that target persister cells will depend heavily on the extent of our knowledge of the mechanisms driving drug tolerance in heterogenous subpopulation of cells in specific clinical contexts. Thus, an important objective of future work should be to continue prioritizing efforts to obtain on-treatment biopsies from patients at the point of minimal residual disease. These studies will be essential to understand the biology of persistence and determine how faithfully the clinical reality is modeled by the experimental models on which the majority of our current understanding of drug tolerance mechanisms and tumor cell persistence is based. Moreover, these efforts will also be important for dissecting the role of the tumor microenvironment, which cannot be addressed well by in vitro models or in vivo studies using immunocompromised mice. The continued evolution of single-cell sequencing methods, as well as tissue-based profiling, such as spatial transcriptomics, highly multiplexed immune fluorescence, and mass spectrometry-based approaches, will allow for a deeper characterization of drug-tolerant persisters cells as well as the surrounding tumor microenvironment in clinical samples. Although the transient nature and low abundance of these cells have made them historically challenging to study, our developing knowledge of the role they play in the evolution of drug resistance and tumor progression will undoubtedly continue to motivate efforts to target them.",

However, although the presence of RAS-mutated clones in CRC resistant to anti-EGFR antibodies is detected prior to treatment in patients and cell lines (13), the same is not observed for EGFR ECD mutations (19,20,63), suggesting that these variants might originate primarily upon treatment or be present at such low frequencies prior to treatment as to evade detection by current sequencing technologies. Indeed in patientderived lung cancer cells treated with gefitinib, Hata and colleagues described both the emergence of early-resistant subclones, derived from preexisting T790M-mutated cells, and the detection of late-emerging resistant populations (65); the latter showed de novo appearance of T790M mutation in drug-tolerant, persister cells (66) in which resistance exists at the epigenetic level. Interestingly, these cells appear to be less sensitive to third-generation EGFR inhibitors (65). Moreover, Ramirez and colleagues demonstrated that multiple resistance mechanisms could emerge from a single drug-tolerant clone of PC9 cells sensitive to erlotinib (67), and drug sensitivity of drug-tolerant PC9 cells is restored by IGF1R inhibition (66). EGFR ECD mutations were shown by Van Emburgh and colleagues to emerge later in cfDNA when compared with RAS mutations and to be associated with longer progression-free survival in patients with metastatic CRC (68); this observation is consistent with a two-step progression model of de novo acquired resistance. Thus, liquid biopsy could possibly be used to identify patients in whom a therapy directed against persister cells might eradicate the reservoirs of drug resistance.\nSeveral reports also highlight that nongenetic mechanisms of resistance are involved in response to targeted therapy and might play an important role in clonal evolution. For example, increased secretion of TGF\u03b2 and amphiregulin by CRC cells resistant to cetuximab was shown to sustain neighboring sensitive cells (69). A study of 67 secondary resistant melanomas treated with MAPK inhibitors revealed that 39% of cases were not accounted for by any validated mutational mechanism (70), suggesting nongenomic adaptive resistance. In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), \u03b3 secretase-resistant persister cells were found to be dependent on chromatin regulator BRD4 overexpression, and BRD4 inhibition resensitized cells to therapy (71). Acquired resistance to anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in NSCLC has been correlated with upregulation of alternative immune checkpoints (50), showing that adaptive epigenetic evolution mediates therapeutic resistance in several settings. Indeed, liquid biopsy might allow effective integration of epigenetic markers by determination of methylation profiles from ctDNA and possibly through the characterization of tumor-derived exosomes (72,73). Transcriptional analysis of circulating tumor cells is also informative as shown by the identification of noncanonical WNT signaling pathway activation in patients with androgen-resistant prostate cancer (74).",

Emerging evidence suggests that cancer cells may adopt similar behavior. Russo et al. examined human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells treated with EGFR antibodies or BRAF inhibitors and found that that drug-tolerant persister cells downregulate mismatch repair (MMR) and homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair genes, whereas error-prone polymerases are upregulated [124]. During treatment, MMR proteins were also downregulated in tumor specimens and patient-derived xenografts. While it remains to be clarified whether this directly contributes to the drug-tolerant phenotype per se, or generates population heterogeneity with increased probability that some clones will have a fitness advantage, these results suggest parallels between tumor cells and bacteria in the ability to evade therapeutic pressure by enhancing mutability.",
